Addressed, but incomplete:

Vaguely describes physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data.

EXAMPLE: "Both the [participating universities] support campus-wide data storage plans under the auspices of their libraries.

Addressed, but incomplete:

Vaguely describes the period of time for which the data will be archived, or this can be inferred because the plan indicates that data will be deposited with a repository or archive.

EXAMPLE: "All data from this project will be made available for a period of at least 3 years after the end date of the project. Since the data from this project will be hosted on the UM website, it will likely be available long after the 3 year period specified above is over."

EXAMPLE: "The PI will retain raw data from the project in case the publicly available processed data needs to be reprocessed or validated."
EXAMPLE: "While CSV files will be shared openly via the IR, the PI will retain proprietary file types for internal ease of use and for use by others upon request."

Addressed, but incomplete:

Provides vague/limited details regarding the types of data that will be retained.

EXAMPLE: "Our project will ensure that the research data are migrated to new formats, platforms, and storage media as required by good practice in a secure environment (e.g., lockable computer systems with passwords, ﬁrewall system in place, power surge protection, virus/malicious intruder protection)"
